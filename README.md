# Morse Code Encryptor & Decryptor

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's `tkinter` library to encrypt and decrypt messages to and from Morse code.

## Features

- **Encrypt a message**: Enter a plain text message, and it will be converted into Morse code.
- **Decrypt a Morse code message**: Enter a Morse code message, and it will be decoded into plain text.
- **Error handling**: Displays error messages if the input fields are empty.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Installation

To run the application, you just need Python installed. `tkinter` comes bundled with Python, so no additional installations are needed.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal/command prompt.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python morse_code.py
